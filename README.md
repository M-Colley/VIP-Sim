## 🧠 Overview

**VIP‑Sim** is a symptom-based, Unity-powered desktop overlay simulator that accurately visualizes visual impairments based on real user input. Built through a **participatory design process** with **7 visually impaired participants (VIP)**, VIP‑Sim applies customizable shaders over any Windows/macOS design tool, simulating over **20 impairments** in a **gaze-contingent** manner.

People with vision impairments (VIPs) often rely on their remaining vision when interacting with user interfaces. Simulating visual impairments has proven to be an effective tool for designers, fostering awareness of the challenges faced by VIPs.
While previous research has introduced various vision impairment simulators, none have yet been developed with the direct involvement of VIPs or thoroughly evaluated from their perspective.
To address this gap, we developed VIP-Sim. This symptom-based vision simulator was created through a participatory design process tailored explicitly for this purpose, involving N=7 VIPs. The process led to the development of a symptom-based vision simulator. 21 symptoms, like field loss or light sensitivity, can be overlaid on desktop design tools. The results show that most participants felt VIP-Sim could replicate their symptoms.
VIP-Sim was received positively, but concerns about exclusion in design and comprehensiveness of the simulation remain, mainly whether it represents the experiences of other VIPs.
